      <p class="py-4 px-8"> My name is Erica Sawyer and I am a college student studying strategic political 
        communications and digital media production. I have a passion for politics, photography, 
        videography and editing. In my ideal world, my future will be uplifting people and showcasing their 
        stories to fight for a better future for us all.
      </p>
      <p class="py-4 px-8">Hailing from southern Missouri, I strive to gain new experiences from people from all backgrounds while carrying my home and family with me.</p>
      <p class="py-4  px-8">I am a proud first-generation college student. Education has been a vital aspect of my 
        life for as long as I can remember. My parents and grandparents have taught me to work hard for the things 
        I am passionate about, and that led me to an education in politics and media.
